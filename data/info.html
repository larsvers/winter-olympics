	<p class="p-info">The <span class="info salient">map</span> is - well - a map and can be used as such. As an additional service it flies you to the destination you're reading about...</p>

<div class="info-wrap">
	<p class="p-info general">Each time you read about a certain event, the three visuals in the bottom change to display the respective data. <br> The titles are fairly self-explanatory...</p>
	<div class="pic-info"><img src="images/explain/explain - nations and medals.png" alt="nations and medals"></div>

	<p class="p-info">The <span class="info salient">Events</span> visual shows each sport &mdash; of which there are surprisingly few, I find &mdash; in a treemap. Hovering over each sport shows the nested disciplines and the number of events per discipline...</p>

<div class="info-wrap">
	<div class="pic-info"><img id="wide" src="images/explain/explain - multiples.png" alt="multiples"></div>
	<p class="p-info">Hit the <span class="info salient">Multiple button</span> on each visual to see a chart for each Olympic event so far. The Athletes and Gender might take a moment to calculate &mdash; sorry &mdash; but is the most playful as you can split up and unite each athlete ball. Much fun!</p>
