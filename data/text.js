They were the &#8220;International Winter Sports Week&#8221; and were a compromise of desires. Held in Chamonix, France they were supposed to be the overdue Winter sibling to the Summer Olympics. However, only a year later they were retrospectively knighted as Olympic Games.</p><p>Shortly after the first Summer Olympic Games were held in 1894, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Balck'>General Viktor Gustav Balck</a> tried to add Winter sports to the schedule. Balck was aptly called the &#8220;father of Swedish sports&#8221; and although he was a charter member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and a good friend of Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games it took until the 1908 London games for some winter sports (mainly figure skating) to be added to the schedule.</p><p>However, Balck realised early on that it would take a while to develop proper Winter Olympics and so went on to launch the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Games'>&#8220;Nordic Games&#8221;</a> which were held from 1901 every 2-4 years until 1926.</p><div class='pic'><img src='images/text/nordic_games.jpg' alt='Nordic games'><sub>By Unknown - Stockholmarnas tidiga 1900-tal, Public Domain, <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14140465'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14140465</a></sub></div><p>Ironically, the Nordic Games precluded the introduction of Winter Olympics as proposals for stand-alone Winter Games were being rejected to maintain the integrity of the Nordic Games.</p><p>Then eventually, 1924 saw the IOC stage the &#8220;International Winter Sports Week&#8221; in Chamonix. Shy to actually call the 11 days &#8220;Olympics&#8221;, it was a test that was passed with flying flags. With 98 events staged in Sochi 2014, the 16 events of 1924 in just 5 sports sounds modest – but it certainly got interest flowing at the time. The IOC renamed the &#8220;Week&#8221; to &#8220;Winter Olympics&#8221; in 1925 retroactively and at last the baby had its name.</p><p>Norway, which was to rule the Winter Olympics a few more times in history made it home with the most medals – a total of 17. Great Britain came third before Austria and Switzerland. Such were the times. (So who came second?)</p>",
	"stmoritz_1928": "<h3 class='text-header'>1928 St. Moritz, Switzerland</h3><p>St. Moritz, Switzerland hosted the 2nd Winter Games, now officially called Olympics from the start. The God of Weather welcomed a whopping 464 athletes with a blizzard during the opening ceremony then sent unseasonably warm weather (up to a sizzling 25 degrees Celsius) during the following days of competition. Understandably disgruntled, the host Switzerland ended up with only a single bronze medal – the lowest output ever generated by a host nation.</p><div class='pic'>	<img src='elephant.jpg' alt='Elephant'>	<sub>By David Blackwell, <a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/mobilestreetlife/4179063482'>https://www.flickr.com/photos/mobilestreetlife/4179063482</a> under CC BY-ND 2.0</sub></div><p>But the main elephant in the room of these early Olympics – at least from a 21st century perspective – was the gender ratio. 26 women competed in St. Moritz – a number dwarfed by the 438 men.

	"lakeplacid_1932": "<h3 class='text-header'>1932 Lake Placid, USA</h3><p>In 1932 the Winter Olympics travelled to the US for the first of four times. Lake Placid in the state of New York hosted the smallest Winter Olympics ever organized with only 252 athletes (just over 8% of them women). Two participants less than the first games in 1924. Most athletes just couldn’t afford the long trip to the US amidst the Great Depression and stayed at home – which was mainly Europe at the time (as 85% of participants were Europeans in 1928).</p><p>The games were supposed to be held in Wrightwood and Big Pines in California, which built the largest ski jump ever constructed, but warm weather conditions forced the whole show to travel east, which wasn’t exactly snowed under but offered enough snow and ice to stage the 3rd Winter Olympics.</p><p>A total of 14 events (we shall have 102 in Pyeongchang 2018) were staged with a total of 7 skating and 4 skiing events as well as 1 bobsleigh competition and 1 ice hockey tournament won by Canada, during over time in an apparently rather tasty match.</p>",
	"garmischpartenkirchen_1936": "<h3 class='text-header'>1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany</h3><p>To the sound of hitherto unrivalled propaganda the 1936 Winter Olympics started on the 6th of February in Germany’s Garmisch-Partenkirchen. This was the last time that both Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same country.</p><p>Alpine Skiing made its Olympic Debut – a rather late addition from a modern perspective as some alpine disciplines like the Downhill competition would nowadays be viewed as an unmissable event. Skiing teachers were barred from the games, which led then already dominant Austrian and Swiss skiers to refrain from participating entirely.</p><p>Norway won the total medal count with 15, more than double the number of medals that second-placed Sweden took home (7). <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Ballangrud'>Ivar Ballangrud</a> alone won 3 Gold medals in Speed Skating.</p><div class='pic'>	<img src='ivar_ballangrud.jpg' alt='ivar_ballangrud'>	<sub>By Alf Schrøder (1880-1951) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons</sub></div><p>Norway, however, faced the problem of carrying home the heaviest medals ever produced with 324 Gram each.

	"stmoritz_1948": "<h3 class='text-header'>1948 St. Moritz, Switzerland</h3><p>World War II muted the winter games for a full 12 years. Sapporo was scheduled for 1940, but was moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen after Japan’s invasion of China in 1938, before getting cancelled entirely after Germany’s Poland invasion. The 1944 games were supposed to take place in Cortina D’Ampezzo, but were also cancelled.</p><p>1948 saw the first post-war Olympic Games in St. Moritz, in neutral and therefore mainly intact Switzerland. It was labeled the &#8220;Games of Renewal&#8221; and was one of the most equally contested games ever, with nearly half of all teams winning a medal.</p><p>Although it was only the second time that Alpine Skiing was classed as Olympic, the sport topped the number of events with 6. That’s 2 events more than Speed Skating.</p><p>But the most amusing story happened on ice – or rather before the ice – as 2 US Ice Hockey teams showed up claiming to be the legitimate representative. That turned out to be a lose-lose situation with both teams being denied participation (although one was allowed to play along without any medal-eligibility).</p",
	"oslo_1952": "<h3 class='text-header'>1952 Oslo, Norway</h3><p>On the 14th of February 1952 the Olympic Games came home in many eyes. Norway, the home of modern skiing and the nation winning most medals in 4 of the hitherto 5 Games, hosted the Olympic Games. They went for it and provided 150,000 people access to the Ski Jump at the legendary Holmenkollen Hill. The largest of all Olympic venues so far.</p><p>The Oslo games were also the first that used computers to calculate figure skating scores. There was one particularly exciting score: US figure skater <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Button'>Richard &#8220;Dick&#8221; Button</a> could have taken it easy and cruising to Gold in his second run, but instead attempted a triple loop - an element no one had ever tried in competition before. He landed it and received a near perfect overall score of 192.</p><p>However, it was Norway once again taking the most medals overall, as well the most Gold medals – amongst which was the Holmenkollen Gold and Silver. Furthermore, Norway gave the world and all future Winter Olympics the so called &#8220;Oslo flag&#8221;, a flag that from hereon would be passed on from one host city to the next.</p><div class='pic'>	<img src='oslo_flag.jpg' alt='oslo_flag'>	<sub>By Dave O from North Vancouver, CANADA - 1952 Oslo Winter Olympic flag, CC BY-SA 2.0, <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9370530'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9370530</a></sub></div>",

Italian skater <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_Caroli'>Guido Caroli</a>  was tasked to skate the torch to the Olympic flame, but on his way he got trapped in a cable and fell. He nearly extinguished the flame on his way down, yet managed to get back up again, igniting the Olympic fire with a sore knee.</p><p>While the previous Oslo games had been the first computerized games, the Cortina games were the first televised games. No TV rights were sold for another 4 years but Cortina was an official test of the attractiveness of televising a large scale sporting event, which worked quite well and still does.</p><p>The gender ratio was still low on a meager 16%, with no improvement from the previous games in Oslo. However, the skiing event ratio was significantly up to nearly 60% of all events, seeing an Austrian athlete winning all three Alpine Skiing events: Toni Sailer, aka the &#8220;Blitz from Kitz&#8221;.</p><div class='pic'>	<img src='toni_sailer.jpg' alt='toni_sailer'>	<sub>By Unknown - <a href='http://www.ssf.or.jp/history/story_06/photo2.html'>http://www.ssf.or.jp/history/story_06/photo2.html</a>, Public Domain, <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40668257'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=40668257</a></sub></div><p>The first of his Gold’s was in the giant slalom, which he won by 6.2 seconds – the largest margin of victory in Olympic history.</p>",
	"squawvalley_1960": "<h3 class='text-header'>1960 Squaw Valley, USA</h3><p>After 28 years the Olympics came back to the US. Squaw Valley, however, was an unlikely candidate as in 1955 it had exactly one permanent resident. <a href='https://skiinghistory.org/lives/alex-cushing'>Alexander Cushing</a> was the owner of the then rather little ski resort. However the bid was won with some support from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurance_Rockefeller'>Laurance Rockefeller</a> and within 4 years Squaw Valley was built into an Olympic host city for roughly US$80 million (the equivalent of around US$700m.

So – to the misery of bob-nation Germany – 1960 was the only Winter Olympics without any bobsleigh-events.</p><p>This, as well as the inclusion of women’s speed skating, allowed the gender ratio to move just beyond the 20% mark for the first time. Other premiers included the first Gold medal for a metal rather than a wooden ski as well as the first ever slow motion on TV. The Slalom officials asked the CBS to review a scene as they were unsure as to whether a skier had missed a gate or not. The TV team played the scene slowly back and forth and quickly grew fond of the little trick, incorporating it swiftly into their routine.</p>",
	"innsbruck_1964": "<h3 class='text-header'>1964 Innsbruck, Austria</h3><p>The 8th Winter Olympic Games in Innsbruck, Austria were warm. So warm that the Austrian army carved out 20,000 blocks of ice from near mountain sites to build luge and bobsleigh tracks. They also conjured up 40,000 cubic meters of snow to the skiing slopes.

	"grenoble_1968": "<h3 class='text-header'>1968 Grenoble, Switzerland</h3><p>In 1968 the Olympics turned colourful. For the first time the games were broadcasted in colour with TV taking center stage in literal terms as the layout and positioning of broadcast facilities meant that the athletes were moved out to more remote areas. Allegedly. Gender tests were another first, hinting at the fear that some men would cross-dress for the occasion. If they did, the tests caught them as the gender-ratio is still at a meager 18% with only 211 of all 1,168 athletes.</p><p>One man in particular raced to victory. Jean-Claude Killy won all three alpine skiing events.

A fate unique to Turin was that it could in fact be viewed on mobile phones for the first time.</p><p>Have a look at the treemap multiple to see how Biathlon has been gaining momentum during the Winter Olympics in the past years, and in 2002 made it to the top 3 in terms of number of events for the first time – sharing the spot with Alpine Skiing.</p> <p>But it was during a Cross-country skiing event (the discipline with the most events) that the mystic Olympic Spirit sparked up again. When Sara Renner <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Renner'></a> of Canada broke one of her poles in the cross-country skiing team sprint, Norwegian head coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rnar_H%C3%A5kensmoen'></a> lent her one of his (albeit 12cm too long).</p> <div class='pic'>	<img src='ski_pole.jpg' alt='ski_pole'>	<sub>By Amer Sports - <a href='http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/amer-sports/images/salomon-s-lab-carbon-248091'>http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/amer-sports/images/salomon-s-lab-carbon-248091</a>, CC BY 3.0, <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=46684292'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=46684292</a></sub></div><p>This act of fair play and sportsmanship allowed Renner to help her team win silver, and dropped Norway out of the medals. </p>",
	"vancouver_2010": "<h3 class='text-header'>2010 Vancouver, Canada</h3><p>The 20th Winter Olympics turned tragic before they started. Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodar_Kumaritashvili'></a> was thrown off track at a speed of 144 km/h and died. In a test event a year before the president of the International Luge Federation commented on the track’s top speed of 154km/h with the words &#8220;It makes me worry&#8221;. The Opening Ceremony some hours later went under way including flags at half-mast and a minute of silence.</p> <div class='pic'>	<img src='opening_vancouver.jpg' alt='opening_vancouver'>	<sub>By Jude Freeman - originally posted to Flickr as _MG_4715, CC BY 2.0, <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9497185'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9497185</a></sub></div><p>Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die at Winter Olympic Games.</p><p>The Vancouver games were also notable for the below-average performance of the Russian team and the above-average performance of the Asian countries. Never below the top 5 since their debut in 1956, Russia finished 6th in total medals inviting President Medvedev to call for the resignation of top officials in the run up to the Russian home Olympics four years later. On a positive note, Asian countries won a total of 31 medals, more than doubling the 15 medals they won just 8 years before. The overall medal table was topped by the US with a record breaking 37 medals. Have a look at the Nations and medal visual and you’ll find especially China, South Korea and Japan doing rather well.</p><p>On another positive note, Vancouver reached the highest women’s ratio of all Games with 1,044 of 2,566 athletes being women – or 41%. Nearly there!</p> ",
	"sochi_2014": "<h3 class='text-header'>2014 Sochi, Russia</h3><p>Sochi was generally considered an odd to place to stage the Winter Olympics as it boasts a subtropical climate with an average 8 degrees in Februray. Most of the outdoor events were hosted in the Krasnaya Polyana ski resort around 70 km from Sochi – but still.</p> <p>Russia did pretty well after their 2010 low point, winning the total medal count before the US and Norway. However, you would need to ignore the large-scale state-backed Russian doping system between 2011 and 2015 in order to enjoy the medal table as a true representation of performance.</p> <p>A (predictable) truly outstanding performance was accomplished by the most decorated Winter Olympian: Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Einar_Bj%C3%B8rndalen'></a> who took two Golds to bring his total Olympic tally to 13 medals, overtook his compatriot Bjørn Dæhlie <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B8rn_D%C3%A6hlie'></a> to become the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time.</p> <div class='pic'>	<img src='bjorndalen.jpg' alt='bjorndalen'>	<sub>By Tor Atle Kleven from Trondheim, Norway - Ole Einar Bjorndalen: IBU World Cup winner 2009 Uploaded by EnemyOfTheState, CC BY-SA 2.0, <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9461022'>https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9461022</a></sub></div><p>Another Norwegian, cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marit_Bj%C3%B8rgen'></a> powered herself to three Gold’s, making it a total of 10 Olympic medals.

Next time in 2018 in the city of Pyeongchang in South Korea and in 2022 in Beijing, China (didn’t they just..?). We’ll probably see more nations, over 100 events (Pyeongchang is likely to see 102 events), nearly 3,000 athletes and maybe even an equal gender ratio at some point…</p> "
